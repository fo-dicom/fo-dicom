#### 5.0.0-alpha3 and prior (2020-11-01)

##### Changes:

* There is only one library built in NetStandard 2.0 *fo-dicom.core*.*
* Use `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`. There is an extension method to `IServiceCollection.AddDefaultDicomServices()` to add all default implementations for the required interfaces.
  * *IFileReferenceFactory:* creates a `IFileReference` instance. Is used internally whenever a Reference to a file is created.
  * *IImageManager:* creates a `IImage` instance. Default is `RawImageManager`, that returns a byte array. call  `IServiceCollection.UseImageManager<MyImageManager>()` to register an other implementation.
  * *ITranscoderManager:* manages the codecs, used by `DicomTranscoder`. Call `IServiceCollection.useTranscoderManager<MyTranscoderManager>()` to register an other implementation.
  * *ILogManager:* creates a concrete implementation of `ILogger`.
  * *INetworkManager:* creates a listner, opens streams or checks connection status.
  * *IDicomClientFactory:* is responsible to return an `IDicomClient` instance. This may be a new instance everytime or a reused instance per host or whateever.
  * *IDicomServerFactory:* creates server instances, manages available ports, etc.
* If there is no DI container provided, fo-dicom creates its own internally. To configure it, call `new DicomSetupBuilder().RegisterServices(s => ...).Build();`
  There are extension methods for this DicomSetupBuilder like `.SkipValidation()` or `SetDicomServiceLogging(logDataPdus, log DimseDataset)`.
  The new interface `IServiceProviderHost` manages, if there is an internal ServiceProvider or if to use a given Asp.Net Service Provider.
* DicomServer uses DI to create the instances of your `DicomService`. You can use constructor injection there.
* Make server providers asynchronous
* A new class `DicomClientOptions` holds all the options of a DicomClient to be passed instead of the huge list of parameters.
* `DicomServerRegistration` manages the started servers per IP/Port.
* Some little memory consumption emprovements in IByteBuffer classes.
* new methods in `IByteBuffer` to directly manipulate/use the data instead of copying it around multiple times.
* Include Json serialization/deserialization directly into *fo-dicom.core* based on `System.Text.Json`.
* Text encoding is now handled when a string is written into a network- or file-stream.
* Switch to IAsyncEnumerator using Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces. LanguageVersion is set to 8.0. 
* internal: SCU now sends two presentation context per CStoreRequest: one with the original TS and one with the additional and the mandatory ImplicitLittleEndian. So the chance is higher to send the file without conversion. (#1048)
* Optimize DicomTag.GetHashCode()
* Bug fix: Prevent special characters in association requests from crashing Fellow Oak DICOM (#1104)
* Make DicomService more memory efficient. Use existing streams in PDU and do not create new Memorystreams for every PDU. (#1091)

##### Breaking changes:

* namespace changed from `Dicom` to `FellowOakDicom`
* `IOManager` is removed. Instead of calling `IOManager.CreateFileReference(path)` now directly create a new instance `new Filereference(path)`. The same is true for `DirecotryReference`.
* In general: all *Manager classes with their static `.SetImplementation` initializers have been replaced by Dependency Injection.
* By default there is only `RawImageManager` implementation for `IImageManager`. To have `WinFormsImageManager` or `WPFImageManager` you have to reference the package *fo-dicom.Imaging.Desktop*. To use `ImageSharpImageManager` you have to reference *fo-dicom.Imaging.ImageSharp*.
* There are only asynchronous server provider interfaces. All synchronous methods have been replaced by asynchronous.
* Instances of `DicomClient` and `DicomServer` are not created directly, but via a `DicomClientFactory` or a `DicomServerFactory`.
  If you are in a "DI-Environment" like Asp.Net, then inject a `IDicomClientFactory` instance and use this to create a DicomClient. otherwise call `DicomClientFactory.CreateDicomClient(...)`.  This is a wrapper around accessing the internal DI container , getting the registered IDicomClientFactory and then calling this. So this is more overhead.
* DicomServiceOptions cannot be passed as parameter to DicomServer constructor/factory any more, but the values of options have to be set to the created instance of DicomServer.
* Classes `DicomFileReader`, `DicomReader`, `DicomReaderCallbackObserver` etc are now internal instead of public, because the resulting Datasets are wrong/inconsistent and need further changes. Therefore its usage is dangerous for users. (#823)
* Removed obsolte methods/classes/properties
  * `DicomValidation.AutoValidation`: Call `DicomSetupBuilder.SkipValidation()` instead.
  * `Dicom.Network.DicomClient`: use `FellowOakDicom.Network.Client.DicomClient` instead.
  * `Dicom.Network.IDicomServiceUser`: use `IDicomClientConnection` instead.
  * `ChangeTransferSyntax(..)` extension methods for `DicomFile` and `DicomDataset`: use the method `Clone(..)` instead.
  * `DicomDataset.Get<T>`: use `GetValue`, `GetValues`, `GetSingleValue` or `GetSequence` instead.
  * `DicomDataset.AddOrUpdatePixelData`:  use `DicomPixelData.AddFrame(IByteBuffer)` to add pixel data to underlying dataset.
  * `DicomUID.Generate(name)`: use `DicomUID.Generate()` instead.
  * `DicomUID.IsValid(uid)`: use `DicomUID.IsValidUid(uid)` instead.
  * `DicomUIDGenerator.Generate()` and `DicomUIDGenerator.GenerateNew()`: use `DicomUIDGenerator.GenerateDerivedFromUUID()`
  * `DicomImage.Dataset`, `DicomImage.PixelData` and `DicomImage.PhotometricInterpretation`: do not load the DicomImage directly from filename if you also need access to the dataset, but load the DicomDataset from file first and then construct the DicomImage from this loaded DicomDataset. Then you can access both.
* DicomStringElement and derived classes do not have the "encoding" parameter in constructor, that takes a string-value
* DicomDataset.Add(OrUpdate) does not take an "encoding" parameter any more, instead the DicomDataset has a property `TextEncoding`, that is applied to all string-based tags.
* in update to DICOM2020e the keywords, that are provided by Nema, are used. therefore some DicomUID-Names changed.
