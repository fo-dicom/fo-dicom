# Documentation for fo-dicom version 5

Fellow Oak DICOM, a DICOM toolkit in C# for all .NET Standard 2.0 compatible frameworks.

_Note_:
`fo-dicom 5` is the first version based on .NET Standard 2.0, earlier versions used Portable Class Library (PCL) instead.
If you still need to rely on PCL, check the latest `fo-dicom 4.x` release and the respective documentation.

## Main features
- Targets .NET Standard 2.0 and will work on all platform supporting that standard
- DICOM dictionary version 2021b
- High-performance, fully asynchronous async/await API
- JPEG (including lossless), JPEG-LS, JPEG2000, and RLE image compression (via additional package)
- Supports very large datasets with content loading on demand
- Image rendering to `System.Drawing.Bitmap` or `SixLabors.ImageSharp`
- JSON and XML import and export
- Anonymization
- DICOM services
- Customize components via DI container
