When deploying *fo-dicom*, the C/C++ based "native" codec libraries can only be used if the Visual C++ 2013 (*fo-dicom* 1.1.0 through 2.0.2) redistributables are installed. On a VS 2013 development computer this is automatically provided for. On a regular computer, it is however necessary to manually install the redistributables. 

For releases after 2.0.2, Visual C++ 2015 redistributables are required. 

The latest, fully patched, releases of all Visual C++ redistributable package versions may be downloaded directly from Microsoft [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).
